The sound installation consists of six objects hanging from the ceiling, which echo their sonic environment. For this, they record, transform and play back, while attempting to steer the soundscape by means of their inherent control logic. Since the output of each object influences its input, the installation creates audible feedback. The objects' agenda is to keep the level in the room at a specified value, which causes them to amplify or attenuate, depending on the input level.",

The Privileged Land (v1.0) is an ongoing multimedia practice of translating the status quo of living in Germany as a South Korean woman in the current times - in the form of a presentable artwork.  Youngji Cho has been struggled to fall asleep since the beginning of October 2023. The ongoing genocide triggered her intergenerational trauma of war, death, colonisation, and division. She sometimes regretted her decision to move to Germany, frustrated, suffering, stuck, feeling privileged, and also ashamed to live in this country. There are many irrational, illogical, and inhumane things happening here and elswhere, and she was unable to produce any works for a while. Then she began to write down some words, sentences, and paragraphs that remained in her mind when she woke up. After writing, she closed her notes and opened her phone to record her voice with her thoughts, feelings, random sounds, and songs that came naturally to her after writing, which was often emotional. The audio of this work is a selection of a few pieces from over 90 recordings over 73 days from December 2023 to February 2024.  The complete work of The Privileged Land (v1.0) is presented as an audiovisual installation on a portrait view of a 4K screen, where a video of a closed flame is played together with an audio collage. The audience may not be sure what the image is when the video starts to play, but as the angle of the video begins to zoom out, they may slowly notice the flame.  Fire, is artificial, yet, primitive.  Fire, may mean the life, the lives, and the light in this universe, where it's common to be dead and dark.  Fire, may show anger, which may motivate some people to survive.  Fire, may warm up some people, and keep them alive.

        "statement": "“The Requiem of Ulam” is a sound installation with a high performative component based on a system of controlled explosions of hydrogen bubbles. The project embodies a criticism of nationalism and questions, from the artistic gesture, the power structures that inhabit concepts such as Homeland or Nation. In its materiality, the work is made up of three important physical parts: a hydrogen producing cell, a conveyor belt and an interactive video system. The hydrogen cell uses electrolysis to break down and separate water into their essential parts: Hydrogen and Oxygen. From this process I grow Hydroxy, a highly flammable gas that, combined with soap and glycerin, I use to create bubbles. Calmly, on the conveyor belt I deposit each bubble in a specific order. Once the drawing is finished, I make the conveyor belt drive the entire score to one of its ends, where a red-hot Nichrome wire will make it explode. By regulating the amount of Hydroxy gas injected and the cadence of the explosions, I can cover a wide spectrum of tones and, thanks to an integrated microphone circuit, amplify, modify and spatialize the sound signal. The explosion of each sequence sings a national anthem in fire and with each verse an interactive video software is fed. The program iterates through a database composed of images and video fragments of the hands of dignitaries, rulers and dictators. With each tune the system advances, changing hand gestures according to the sound. Once the sound sequence has concluded, the process is repeated with the next anthem and so on until the recognized countries that have military potential are covered. The performative gesture in this work is based on the implementation of the entire system, the piece as a whole is an instrument and my role is to make it sound. The audience will contemplate each part of the process and will be surrounded by the sound of the explosions, at the mercy of the tunes. The name of the work refers to the figure of the important Polish mathematician Stanisław Marcin Ulam, creator of the Teller-Ulam method from which it was possible to develop the hydrogen bomb; the greatest destructive power in the modern world. Drawing inspiration from the intricate mechanics of sound devices and the intricate dance of electrochemical processes, this piece delves into the enigmatic realms of control and power doctrines. It ventures to unravel the intricate web where the order of our thoughts is ensnared by the pervasive influence of the State, shaping our very perception of reality. Amidst the tapestry of ideologies—Patriotisms, Nationalisms, Regionalisms—we find ourselves navigating daily, assuming roles and affiliations as social beings. Often, we find ourselves echoing historical hymns and mirroring the ideals of others, neglecting to explore our own convictions. We seek refuge in flags, speak of freedom without truly experiencing it, and ardently defend the arbitrary lines of demarcation we call borders. \"The Requiem of Ulam\" emerges as a testament to the marriage of science and art, echoing the transformative symphony of water igniting into flame.",

It weaves the complex dialogue between historical diaslides and contemporary digital emanations.   The medium of collectible, archival, and simply discarded transparencies is disconnected from its original contexts. PNCTM reanimates these fragments by engaging AI and generative tools to expand, distort, reimagine and highlight the static images. This process mirrors the fluidity and transcience of memory, as it fades, transforms and distorts over time. The intermedial dialogue embodies the idea of the plurality of perception.   Each object in the installation invites the viewer to make a personal connection with the imagery through a literal lens. A magnifying glass intensifies the viewing experience, seeking an ASMR effect, and concentrating the attention on the micro-movements and shifts in the narratives unfolding through the overlays.   Inspired by Roland Barthes' notion of the 'punctum' in 'Camera Lucida', the installation seeks to evoke the unexpected, poignant moment of personal resonance within each viewer. Drawing on David Le Breton's perspectives on perception and Susan Sontag's critical exploration of photography and memory, the installation challenges viewers to consider how memories are constructed and reconstructed — shaped by individual subjective lenses and the collective memory of society.   By combining tactile historical media with fluid digital interactions, PNCTM aims to evoke a reflective dialogue about the impermanence and malleability of memory. It invites viewers to discover their own perceptions, and their unique punctums, and to engage in a deeper conversation about the manipulation of historical narratives through contemporary lenses.",

In any urban space, there are wild grasses, microorganisms, etc., but our living spaces are extremely exclusive. Humans only allow people and a few other species into these spaces, leaving many beings, such as invisible microorganisms like bacteria and viruses, excluded. According to Michael Pollan's viewpoint, only certain species that satisfy human needs become dominant on a global scale. Although the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) has not officially recognized the Anthropocene as a geological epoch, our actions and ways of seeing things have already created a new geological era. Future beings or humans examining the geological period of our current existence will find it distinct from others. Amid the currents of era and technological advancement, humans have gradually evolved into beings that require technological intermediation. Thus, for posthumanists, \"human\" now resembles a bizarre animal robot.  In this work, I utilize Arduino to receive biological signals from plants and transmit these signals into 18 nodes. When these nodes are activated, 18 corresponding electrodes inside the mouth output electrical stimulations ranging from 1 to 5 volts to the wearer's tongue according to the plant's signals, inviting viewers to perceive the plant and its environment through their tongues. The mouth is a highly sensitive personal space. Through this interface, I aim to break down the boundaries between the body and the environment, emphasizing the complex interweaving and entanglement among humans, non-humans, and technology. It suggests the dissolution of self/other, human/non-human boundaries, urging participants to internalize their connection with the plant world. It also deconstructs the artificial separation between humans and other animals, highlighting the continuity and common vulnerability among different species. This interaction with \"animality\" sparks reflection on the primal, instinctual aspects of human interaction with the natural world and establishes species-shared connections, communication, and care through \"kissing.\" This intimate act symbolizes not only a union with nature but also a tangible, bodily connection. As Donna Haraway proposes in \"A Cyborg Manifesto,\" the concept of the Cyborg—a hybrid of machine and organism—represents a biological entity in social reality that transcends traditional boundaries of gender, species, and identity. The wearable device in this work embodies this intersection of cyborg, merging human biological processes with technological interventions to promote a form of communication that surpasses human sensory organs.",

        "statement": "In this video essay, leak in the promiscuous machines and prurient governing entities is brought to the forefront as systemic vulnerabilities. A message you send out to your loved one over the TCP/IP protocol is slutty. Audio and video signal cables are constantly radiating RF emanations. Buffer overflows when data overwrites, memory leaks when the old memory is not released, software ages, like human beings, aging leads to more leaks. In addition to that, our faces are reduced to facial features for machine learning, personal medical records end as image embedding in a training dataset. We, as users and as citizens, are encouraged by the big tech and governments to leak, while the large language models trained from the data we leaked, refuse to “participate in or encourage any illegal activities, including leaking.”  let yourself l̴͓̥̠̼̏̑̃̂̂͘ḛ̷̺̟͓͈̜̓̋̍̄̆ä̸̞̝̳́̾̓̈̾k̷͎̰̓̒͘ a little leaks through the cracks on the leaking gas pipe, the space station, the express warehouse, into the leaking signals, leaky compression algorithms, leaky network packets, leaking categories, leaked tiny face and tiny activity dataset, to ask who is making it’s not ok to leak, who is capturing leak, how leak is weaponized and who is killing leak to stop solidarity from happening.",
